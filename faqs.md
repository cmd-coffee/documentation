### Our Coffee
1. Do you have a dark roast?
> In order to preserve the original tasting notes of each bean, we roast light-medium. However, we have beans that have a rich mouthfeel and other qualities that seem "dark." If you want a "dark roast" try out the "Meeting Day" blend.

2. Where is your coffee roasted?
> The coffee is roasted in New York. 

3. Can you grind the coffee for me?
> Once coffee is ground it goes stale in about 15 minutes. In order to ensure you have the best coffee experience, we ship our beans whole.

4. Is your coffee organic?
> While we frequently have beans that are organically grown, our roasting process and facilities are not organically certified. 

5. What happened to that single origin coffee I ordered last time?
> We rotate our available single origin options throughout the year. If there was something you loved, you can email us at support@cmd.coffee and we'll let you know what has a similar flavor profile.

6. What is single origin coffee?
> Essentially, single origin is coffee talk for knowing the region, producer, or crop where your beans originated. So, when we offer you beans of Costa Rica Cumbres del Poas we know that the beans were caringly produced by Dona Francisca and Oscar Chacon, a husband and wife living in the central valley region of Costa Rica. 

7. What is micro-roasting?
> It means we roast our coffee in very small batches. Currently, each batch is about ten pounds.

8. Are software developers roasting the coffee?
> Sometimes. It depends who is roasting that day.

9. How long have you been roasting coffee commercially?
> We've been roasting coffee at our brick an mortar coffee shop since 2010.
