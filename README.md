### About cmd.coffee
We provide a simple REST API to order high-end, micro roasted coffee. It is in the early stages so expect the API to change and please forgive us for any inconvenience. The roasting side of the business has been around since 2010, so even though the API is a little rough around the edges, the coffee quality is consistently exceptional. 

We also have some CLIs in the works. The first one we've released is in crystal. Stay tuned for more

In the meantime:

### Workflow
1. Join
2. View products
3. Post order-request
4. Pay via cryptocurrency
5. Wait
6. Drink and enjoy
7. Repeat 2-6

#### Join
Before ordering, you need an access-key. You get this by joining. To join, you need an invite-code. Right now we are inviting people privately.

Keep your access-key safe and store it someplace reliable like a post-it on your monitor. Better yet, store it using a secure service like LastPass or 1Password. It cannot be reset and we can't get it. You need it to access your order history and check the status of any outstanding orders.

#### View Products
Yup. Do that. See what pops out. We have some standard blends which are always available, like "meeting day" and "the stand up." We think the names speak for themselves, but you can always read the description and tasting-notes to get more info. We also have single-origin options, which are rotated regularly. With an ever changing menu, its important to keep an open mind to life with many flavor profiles.

#### Request Order
You'll need your Access-Key for this. Send us the product-key and an address. We'll respond with an order-key and payment options.

#### Pay via Cryptocurrency
It is your responsibility to send the funds before the order expires. In case you are unable to send the money, the order will be canceled.

#### Wait
Once we receive payment, we work on getting the coffee to you. If what you ordered is freshly roasted and ready to go, we'll send it out immediately. In case we need to roast it, we'll do that, then send it out the next business day.

#### Drink and enjoy
This is the fun part. You'll need a scale, a burr grinder and brewing device of some sort.

#### Repeat 2-6
The shelf life of coffee is about 3 weeks. A single person drinking about 2 cups of coffee a day will use up 12oz in about 2 weeks. If we were this person, we would order coffee a week before running out, which would be about a week after it was opened.
