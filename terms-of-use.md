#### Proposition 65 Warning

The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, popularly known as Proposition 65, is a California law intended to protect California citizens from chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm and to inform citizens about exposures to such chemicals. One such chemical is acrylamide, which may be present in coffee, including the coffee sold by Cmd.Coffee. Acrylamide is a naturally occurring byproduct formed when certain sugars and an amino acid react to high temperatures, such as when coffee is roasted. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not determined that the low levels of acrylamide naturally found in roasted coffee have any public health impact. Your personal cancer risk is affected by a wide variety of factors. For more information on acrylamide, please consult the FDA’s website at fda.gov. For more information about both acrylamide and Proposition 65, please visit www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65.html.

#### Governing Law and Jurisdiction
All matters relating to our Services and these Terms and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision. Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms or our Services is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Suffolk County, New York. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration
Please read this section carefully. It affects your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.

YOU AND CMD.COFFEE AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING YOUR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS THROUGH THE SERVICES, EXCLUDING ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY THAT QUALIFIES FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR RATHER THAN IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR A JURY.

This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and expressly includes claims brought under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227, or any other statute, regulation, or legal or equitable theory.

Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (”AAA”) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the ”AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section. The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to arbitrability and/or enforceability of this arbitration provision, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge that the arbitration provision or the agreement is void, voidable or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity. Any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you prevail on any claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys’ fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to you under the standards for fee shifting provided by law.

Small Claims Court. You may elect to pursue your claim in small-claims court rather than arbitration if you provide us with written notice of your intention to do so. The small-claims court proceeding will be limited solely to your individual dispute or controversy.

Class Action Waiver. You agree to an arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR CMD.COFFEE WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.

#### Waiver and Severability
No waiver by Cmd.Coffee of any term or condition set forth in these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Cmd.Coffee to assert a right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these terms will continue in full force and effect.

#### Entire Agreement
These Terms and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Cmd.Coffee with respect to our Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to our Services. In the event you later agree to additional terms and conditions applicable to the Services, such as terms and conditions governing a rewards program, such terms and conditions are made part of these Terms of Use by reference.
